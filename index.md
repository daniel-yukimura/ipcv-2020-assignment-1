## Assignment 1

In this assignment you will practice working with the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment and [PyTorch](pytorch.org). You'll also practice setting a simple image classification pipeline. The goals of this practice are the following:

* Gain experience setting and using notebooks on Google Colab.
* Develop familiarity with basic structures of PyTorch: tensors, autograd, modules.
* Practice dealing with image data.
* Understand better the data-driven approach.
* Practice setting a image classification pipeline.
* Train a neural network as a image classifier.
* Understand the train/test/val data split, and learn how to evaluate and adjust your system.
* Use visualization tools to evaluate your work.


### Instructions:

0. If you're using Google Colab, you just need to have a google account and an associated Google Drive. In case you're choosing to work locally in your machine you must set Anaconda or a `venv` virtual environment, and install the necessary libraries.

1. Copy to your drive or download the following notebook:

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook for completing the assignment.

3. You can build auxiliary `.py` scripts and call them from your notebook, for organizational purposes.

### Submission

The assignment is due on **Friday, September 18 2020** at 11:59pm (GMT-3).

IMPA students that are regularly enrolled in the program should send their assignments before the due date to <yukimura@impa.br> with a copy to <lvelho@impa.br>. Late delivers will be consider subject to a lower score.

The submission email should be sent with the subject **"Assignment 1 - [first-name] - [last-name]"**. The assignment can be structured and sent in two ways:
* If your whole solution is implemented in the same notebook as the one provided for the assignment, then you can send just the `.ipynb` file as the solution.
* If parts of your implementation were done in auxiliary `.py` scripts, then you must send both the final notebook and the scripts inside a `.zip` file.

The organization of the code will also be considered in the evaluation.
